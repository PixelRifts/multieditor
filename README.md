# multieditor
Made for the HMN Wheel Reinvention Jam 2022


An Application to provide editors for multiple file formats via plugins.

A plugin will be associated with specific file extensions, which when opened through a file explorer, will open that file with the plugin.
Plugins will be able to render arbitrary stuff.

I have attached my own solid state visualizer, (.solidstate), a png viewer that just displays the image (.png) and a particle system editor plugin (.psys)

Hotkeys
In the file system:
Ctrl+D: Change Drive to '<Drive>:'
Alt+LeftArrow: Exit Plugin
